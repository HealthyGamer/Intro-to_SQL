# Table Terminology

You can do a lot with a single table, but to leverage the true power of DBs, we need to be able to create multiple tables and connect them. First, it might be helpful to talk about a few of the features that make up a table beyond columns and rows.

## SQL Table Concepts

### Constraints

Constraints allow us to make rules about what a column can and cannot contain. Things like `NULL` and `NOT NULL` are constraints. There are a ton of options here, but we are only going to talk about keys for today.

### Keys

Keys are columns that we've given a special purpose in the table. While there are quite a few different types, we will focus on just two.

#### Primary Keys

Primary keys are used to identify a specific row, similar to row numbers. You could build a table without one, but it goes against best practices.

- They cannot be null.
- They must be unique.
- They should not change.

While it is technically possible to use any bit of data that follow those three rules as a primary key, we usually add a separate ID column to act as our primary key. This is either an integer or UUID.

##### Integer PKs

The main advantage of using integers as primary keys is that they are compact to store. There isn't any data stored in this column, so if possible, we want to make it take up a minimal amount of space. Most SQL database engines will also allow you to make this column "auto-increment," which just means that the database engine will simply assign each row in the series. In the table we worked with last week, we used this to insert data into the table without specifying the ID column.

The main challenge with integer IDs is that we can run into the issue of collisions in larger database systems. You'll have multiple servers working together, and having a single server decide on IDs creates a bottleneck. This is why we often use UUIDs instead.

##### UUID

UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. In the Microsoft world, you will sometimes see a variant GUID or Globally Unique Identifier, but they refer to the same concept.

A UUID is a randomized 128-bit identifier. We usually show this as a string of 32 characters made up of lowercase letters and numbers. Even distributed systems can make use of UUIDs without concerning themselves with collision.

The first question is always, "But Panda, if it's random, the same value could be randomly assigned twice." True, but we'll be long dead before that happens. There are 2^127 possible values, which is 1.7 followed by 38 zeros. No database table in the world will come even. To give you an idea of how far we are, some of the largest companies in the world are starting to work with data that is [exabytes](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-microsoft-drives-exabyte-analytics-on-the-world-s-largest-yarn-cluster/) in scale. Even if each row were as small as 1 byte, that would be 2^60 rows or a small fraction of possible values.

Another way to look at it is how long it would take to generate a duplicate. At one UUID per second, it would take around [a billion years](https://towardsdatascience.com/are-uuids-really-unique-57eb80fc2a87) to have a reasonable chance of creating a duplicate. If technology ever does get to a point where we are generating data fast enough for this to be an issue, we'll just add more digits.

#### Foreign Keys

One of the most valuable things we can do with keys is to create references to them in other tables. Just as with primary keys, you don't have to set your reference to a foreign key, but the DB engine will often help you ensure that the reference is valid if you do.

### Indexes

Creating and maintaining indexes is a big part of why database administrators have job. A discussion of indexing strategies is beyond the scope of an intro series, but it is good to know they exist to research them more if you are interested. As with keys, there are several different types, and design heavily depends on the underlying engine.

An index is basically a separate copy of part of a table written in a different order than the primary copy.

Say we have a table of customers, and we often pull up names and addresses based on their phone numbers. We can create an index on these three things, ordered by the phone number. This will allow the database engine to know exactly where to find the data so that queries will return faster.
