Customer
Items
Sales
Location
Dates
Shipping info
Returns

Design is informed by how the data is physically stored.
Relational vs. Document and column stores.
Normalized application vs star schema reporting

Relational db
Data stored in rows organized into columns
What is in each table and relationships between the tables is primary concern in design

Relationships 1-1, 1-m, m-m
1 dog - 1 harness
1 ownee - 2 dogs
2 dogs - things they need to smell

Primary key (unique identifier) (topic/composite key)

DB normalization
Definition of “Primary Key”
1st normal form
Each column contains one value
2nd normal form
Separate tables for things that appear in multiple rows
3rd normal
Separate tables for things not related to the primary key
4th normal
Separate tables based on dependencies
5th normal
Every dependant column is dependant on all key columns

Query plans/indexing
Clustered indexes
Non-clustered (btree)
Hash
Full text

Partitioning horizontal vs vertical

Acid - atomicity consistency. Isolation, durability

Referential integrity

Star schemas
